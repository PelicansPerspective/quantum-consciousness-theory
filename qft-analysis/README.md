# QFT Analysis

This directory contains quantum field theory analysis tools for the Hyperchronal Framework.

## Contents

- `vev_analysis.py` - Vacuum expectation value calculation and stability analysis
- (More scripts to be added: loop corrections, renormalization, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
python vev_analysis.py
```

## Requirements

- SymPy for symbolic mathematics
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for plotting

## Research Focus

1. **Renormalizability**: Proving the theory is renormalizable at one-loop and beyond
2. **Stability Analysis**: Investigating vacuum stability and false vacuum decay
3. **Phenomenological Predictions**: Calculating observables for experimental tests
