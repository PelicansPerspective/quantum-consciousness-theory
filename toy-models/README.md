# Toy Models

This directory contains toy models exploring quantum-biological coupling via the Hyperchronal Framework.

## Contents

- `quantum_bio_coupling.py` - Quantum Zeno effects in microtubule-hyperchronal field interactions
- (More models to be added: consciousness correlates, neural quantum coherence, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
python quantum_bio_coupling.py
```

## Requirements

- QuTiP for quantum optics calculations
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Research Focus

1. **Quantum Biology**: Quantum coherence in biological systems
2. **Consciousness Models**: Speculative connections to awareness
3. **Quantum Zeno Effects**: Measurement-induced dynamics in bio-systems
4. **Neural Correlates**: Microtubule quantum states and brain function

**Note**: These are highly speculative theoretical models for research purposes.
