# Cosmological Simulations

This directory contains cosmological simulation codes for the Hyperchronal Framework.

## Contents

- `quintessence_evolution.py` - Cosmological evolution with hyperchronal dark energy
- (More simulations to be added: CMB, LSS, skyrmion dynamics, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
python quintessence_evolution.py
```

## Requirements

- NumPy/SciPy for numerical integration
- Astropy for cosmological calculations  
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Research Focus

1. **Early Universe**: Inflation and reheating with hyperchronal field
2. **Dark Energy**: Quintessence evolution and equation of state
3. **Large-Scale Structure**: Galaxy formation and cosmic web evolution
4. **CMB Analysis**: Comparison with Planck and other observational data
