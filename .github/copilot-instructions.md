# Hyperchronal Framework Project Instructions

This is a theoretical physics research project focused on the Hyperchronal Framework - a theory that unifies consciousness, cosmology, and quantum mechanics through a recursive scalar field Î¨.

## Project Context
- Focus on scientific rigor and mathematical precision
- Use standard physics notation and conventions
- Prefer symbolic mathematics with SymPy for theoretical work
- Use NumPy/SciPy for numerical computations
- QuTiP for quantum simulations
- Astropy for cosmological calculations

## Code Style
- Follow Python scientific computing best practices
- Document mathematical equations in LaTeX format in docstrings
- Include physical units and dimensional analysis
- Comment complex mathematical derivations
- Use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization

## Research Areas
1. QFT Analysis - renormalizability, loop corrections, field stability
2. Cosmological Simulations - early universe, large-scale structure, skyrmion dynamics  
3. Toy Models - quantum-biological coupling, quantum Zeno effects in microtubules
